# SQL-Projects-

Welcome to my SQL Projects repository! 
This portfolio showcases various SQL solutions I've developed to 
     -analyze,
     -process, 
     -and manage data to derive actionable insights.
Here, you'll find examples of 
      -data transformation, 
      -querying, 
      -data validation, 
      -data cleaning, and 
      -data visualization projects using SQL databases like PostgreSQL, SQLite, and other relational databases. 
Each project is designed to demonstrate my ability to handle complex data structures, write efficient SQL queries, and produce meaningful results for business analysis and decision-making.
